Some imp fearues of our project:
1 Progressive Web App (PWA):
This platform's browser is based and built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It efficiently works on low-cost devices, and there is no need for installation.

2 Offline Access with Service Workers:
Lessons, games, and flashcards are all cached locally. This allows students to keep learning even if they lose internet connectivity.

3 Local Data Storage:
Student progress is saved using browser Local Storage or IndexedDB when needed. All data syncs automatically whenever an internet connection becomes available.

4 Interactive Learning Modules:
These modules feature lightweight Canvas mini-games and flashcards for effective revision.

5 Teacher Content Management:
All the content is stored in simple JSON or CSV files. Teachers can easily add flashcards or quizzes.

6 Offline Content Distribution:
There is no dependence on continuous internet connection. Lessons and media can be distributed through local school servers.

7 Multilingual & Accessible Design:
The web app supports multiple languages and also features large fonts and a simple user interface to ensure inclusivity.
